Temperature and humidity are reported at a fixed 60 minute interval.

## Pairing
Hold the orange button until three dots appear at the top left of the screen.

## ZHA
The device seems to reset every 150 seconds and this causes the temperature to be reported, via ZigBee (not on the display), as 0 degrees, and the display displays 0 Lux. Continuous resets, at least once, caused a small "!" to appear on the screen while virtually nothing was updated, suggesting some internal processing error. 

This impact of this issue can be reduced by creating a template sensor in the home assistant configuration.yaml. (supposing the real measured value is not 0 degrees)

``` 
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Moes Thermometer Temperature Filtered" 
        state: >-
          {## Enter the entity_id of the thermometer below ##}
          {% set moes_measurement = float(states("sensor.moes_thermometer_temperature"))  %}   
          
          {% if moes_measurement != 0  %}
            {## Use the measured value ##}
            {{ moes_measurement }}
          {% else %}
            {## Don't change the state ##}
            {{ 
              states("sensor.moes_thermometer_temperature_filtered") {## Should match with the name entered above ##}
            }}
          {% endif %}
        unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
``` 

For this template sensor to work properly, it's required for its entity (in the example: sensor.moes_thermometer_temperature_filtered) to be included in the [recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter). Optionally, the unit of measurement can be changed to match with what's displayed on the e-ink screen.
The same method can be used for the humidity.

## Z2M
Same problems with Z2M.

## Device not suitable for home automation
- Reports temperature / humidity  every hours, can't be used for controlling heater or dehumidifier
- Hangs when not used with tuya hub.
